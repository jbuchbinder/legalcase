  <p>After registering a new case, it is automatically added to the list of Your cases. Since you are its creator, therefore you are the one responsible and engaged with work on this case.</p>

  <p>However, sometimes it might happen that you should work together with another colleague (or colleagues) on the same case. E.g. you might include your assistant who is involved with the case. The LCM software is made in the way so that it encourages the collaboration and co-operation among the
  users, and therefore it allows you to add more users to a certain case, making them equal contributors.</p>

  <p><b>In order to add a new user to a case</b>, follow the steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Select a case from the &#8220;My cases&#8221; page (accessible by clicking on the &#8220;Cases&#8221; from the main menu).</li>

    <li>In order to open the page for choice of users, click on the button &#8220;Add a user to a case&#8221; from the page &#8220;Case details&#8221; | &#8220;General&#8221; | &#8220;General information&#8221;.</li>

    <li>The page for chosing users shows a list of names of all the users registered in the system.

      <ul>
        <li>If the users are more than 15, the page is divided into pages. You can go through the pages by clicking on the hyperlinks &#8220;Next&#8221; and &#8220;Previous&#8221;, situated in the lower part of the list, or by clicking directly on the number of the respective page.</li>

        <li>If the pages are too many, you can use the search field by:

          <ul>
            <li>clicking on the text field &#8220;Find user&#8221;</li>

            <li>introduce name or part of name of certain user</li>

            <li>click on the button &#8220;Search&#8221; and check the list that will appear with the eventual results.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Use the fiels on the left side to tick on the user(s) you choose to add to your case.</li>

    <li>Click on the &#8220;Validate&#8221; button in order to confirm your choice.</li>

    <li>Go on with choosing and adding more users to the case or use the hyperlink on top to go back to your case.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><b>NB!</b> Once adding user to your case, you cannot totally remove her/him from it. Instead, you can specify access rights of each of the users, associated to certain case.</p>

  <p><b>In order to specify the access rights of a user on a certain case</b>, follow the steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Choose a case from the page &#8220;My cases&#8221; (accessible by clicking on &#8220;Cases&#8221; from the main menu).</li>

    <li>In the case details is shown a list of the users, associated to this case.</li>

    <li>Click on the pictogram, illustrating a hand, situated on the left side of the name of the user, to which you want to specify access rights.</li>

    <li>Opens a page called &#8220;Edite access rights&#8221;. From the dropdown menu &#8220;Access right&#8221; choose one of the following possibilities:

      <ul>
        <li>Consult case information</li>

        <li>Add information to the case</li>

        <li>Case administrator</li>

        <li>Un-assign from a case</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Click on the button &#8220;Validate&#8221; in order to confirm your choice.</li>

  <p>Each case, registered in the consulting centre, operates with persons or organisations who are external to the centre - the so called clients. These are persons and/or institutions, who have requested the consulting centre to work on a certain case. LCM identifies two types of clients:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>physical persons (called herein <span class="textit">clients</span>)</li>

    <li>juridical persons (<span class="textit">organisations</span>)</li>
  </ul>
