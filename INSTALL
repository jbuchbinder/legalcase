0.2. Quick start
================

To start the LCM installation assistant, procede with the following steps.

Download the latest tar.gz archive from our Source Forge project page
<http://sf.net/projects/legalcase> and uncompress it in a temporary
directory:

    $ cd /tmp/
    $ tar xzf /path/to/legalcase-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

After decompressing the archive, there will be a new directory called legalcase:

    $ ls -l

    drwxr-xr-x 6 user user 4096 2005-03-09 10:26 legalcase

Move the legalcase directory in a space accessible by the Apache Web server:

    $ mv legalcase /var/www/

Provide the permission to "write" to the Apache Web server for the directories
log, inc/config and inc/data:

    $ cd /var/www/legalcase/
    $ chmod a+rw log inc/config inc/data

Access to this directory from your Web browser: <http://localhost/legalcase/> 
and follow the instructions from the installation assistant.
